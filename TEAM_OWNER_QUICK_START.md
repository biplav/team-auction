## 6. Budget Rules (IMPORTANT!)

### The Three Numbers to Watch:

1. **Remaining Budget** (Green)
   - How much money you have left
   - Updates instantly when you win a player

2. **Maximum Allowable Bid** (Yellow/Orange box)
   - The system calculates this for you
   - Ensures you have enough left to complete your squad
   - NEVER bid above this amount

3. **Current Squad** (Blue box)
   - Shows players purchased / minimum required
   - Example: "8 / 11" means you need 3 more players minimum

### Why Can't I Bid?

**"Squad Full - Cannot Bid"**
- You've reached maximum squad size (e.g., 15 players)
- Can't buy more players

**"Cannot Afford This Player"**
- Player's base price is too high
- You need to save budget for other required players
- Skip this player

**"Bid exceeds maximum allowable amount"**
- Your bid is too high
- Lower it to the maximum shown in yellow box
- This protects you from running out of budget

---

## 7. Budget Example

**Your Situation:**
- Remaining Budget: ₹60,00,000
- Current Squad: 8 players
- Minimum Required: 11 players
- Need: 3 more players
- Minimum Price Per Player: ₹5,00,000

**System Calculation:**
- Reserve for 3 players: 3 × ₹5,00,000 = ₹15,00,000
- **Maximum You Can Bid: ₹60,00,000 - ₹15,00,000 = ₹45,00,000**

This ensures you can always complete your minimum squad!

## 8. Tips for Success

### Before Auction:
✅ Know minimum squad size (usually 11 players)
✅ Know maximum squad size (usually 15 players)
✅ Plan roughly which roles you need (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders)

### During Auction:
✅ **Keep the page open** - Real-time updates need active connection
✅ **Watch the timer** - Act quickly when you want a player
✅ **Don't overspend early** - Save budget for later players
✅ **Use quick buttons** - Faster than typing
✅ **Check max allowable bid** - Always visible in yellow box

### Budget Strategy:
✅ **Don't spend it all early** - You need 11+ players minimum
✅ **Save for key players** - Budget some extra for must-have players
✅ **Watch the color bar** - Green=good, Yellow=careful, Red=risky
